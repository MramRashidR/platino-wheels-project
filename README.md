# Project 3 Unit 3 E-Commerce Website	

## Project idea	
The idea of the project is to design a full stack working website about selling and purchasing luxuries cars. So our team had developed a website called “Platino Wheels” based on that idea, and we were given one week to finish the project so as a start up to build the website without any conflict the team was divided into pairs the first one worked on the backend and the second pair worked on the frontend. 
 
## Team members:
- Noor Abdulla– Maram Rashed – Hessa Bubeshait – Salman Hikmat

**The Website will contain multiple pages these pages are: **
- Home Page                                                       - Category page
- About Page                                                       - Policy page
- Contact-Us page                                               - Sign up page
- Log-in page                                                       - Log-out     

## Features
The website had been built based on two models the user model which contains the user name, E-mail and password and a feature called “Authentication” had been used to make the model function properly. 
The second model is the cars model which contains all the cars information, both of the models were made using mongo db.
React software had been used to run the pages rapidly with the ability to avoid opening multiple pages for the website to fully work.
The user can view all cars offered for sale in the category page where there is multiple of luxuries brands the user can browse.
At the same category page there is an important feature which is the option to sell the car, this feature allows the user to offer his car for sale which is done by linking the selling form with the cars model.

# Challenges 
1-	Creating the database was a challenge for the back-end developers.
2-	Being always up to date with the team and avoiding conflicts and bugs was challenging because of the GitHub mechanisms.

#Future ideas
-	There is some bugs that needs to be removed and covered.
-	Improvement on the car model where the car pictures will be clearly displayed on the category page.
-	Adding a filter for the user to easily browse the website and find the car they want as fast as possible.
